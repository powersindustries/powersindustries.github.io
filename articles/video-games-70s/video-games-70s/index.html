                <p>The 1970s was a revolutionary decade for the film industry. Many film historians consider the 70s as a turning point for the medium. In a 10 year span, legendary films like Alien, Apocalypse Now, The Godfather, Halloween, Jaws, Taxi Driver, and many others were released to the masses. Before the 70s, movies like My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music, The Wizard of Oz, and other similar films dominated the box office. What brought about this change in the industry and why was this decade of film so revolutionary? It seems to be the culmination of a number of things.</p>
<p>First, by the time the 70s rolled around, film technology had become readily available to the average consumer. The first home camcorders were invented in the 60s and became more accessible and cheaper to purchase by the 70s. With cameras and film stock becoming cheaper to manufacture and purchase, anyone could get access to a camera and start recording.</p>
<p>Second, the 70s marked the ending of the <em>Old</em> Hollywood system and brought about the New Hollywood system. The <em>Old</em> Hollywood system slowly ran out of money over the course of a few decades bringing about a need for new ideas and management. This new guard came into the scene and changed up the system for the better.</p>
<p>Then last, the philosophy for making films changed during this decade. Within the <em>Old</em> Hollywood system, films were cast, written, and directed by the big studios themselves. In the <em>New</em> Hollywood system, the philosophy for making films changed. Instead of the big studios making every film themselves, the studios began paying directors to make films for them.</p>
<p>The way it worked was that a big studio would give a director and their team a budget to make whatever they wanted (Within reason). Then, that director would return to the studio with a completed film. This process created the <em>Auteur Theory</em> of film making.</p>
<p>Auteur films are thought of as being the directorâ€™s creative vision, instead of a creation of the studio system itself. As more Auteur films were released, films changed from being focused on a central message to being focusing on characterization and drama. This change in philosophy brought about the rise of directors like Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and many others that we know and love today.</p>
<p>What does this long winded explanation of the 70s film industry have to do with the video game industry? In recent years, the film and video game industries have been compared to each other quite often. When thinking about it, it makes sense. Both films and video games require a diverse team of artists and engineers to create. Also, they both require significant funding and time to do properly.</p>
<p>Despite their similarities, why does my mom know who Micky Mouse is, but not Mario? It is because the film industry has had decades to insert itself into pop culture. Hollywood technically began in the early 1900s, with countless foreign films coming out decades before. Meanwhile, video games began in the 1970s (Sort of? It is hard to pinpoint its exact origin). Even though the video game industry has had less time to mature, it is quickly catching up and even surpassing to the film industry in sales and critical reception.</p>
<p>Compared to the trajectory of the film industry, where does the video game industry currently lie? In my opinion, the video game industry is about to enter a 70s decade of their own.</p>
<p>Following the same events that led up to the 70s film industry, many of the same beats have recently happened in the video games industry.</p>
<p>For starters, the technology for making games has become readily available to the masses. With commercial game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine, anyone can install software on their computers and begin making games. With online resources like YouTube, Udemy, Gumroad, Skillshare, etc anyone can learn the skills needed to get started for a reasonable price or even free. The tools for making games are readily available to anyone. Just like a kid from the 70s with a home camcorder, anyone can go in their backyard and start making art.</p>
<p>Next, to me it looks like the <em>Old</em> video game system has ended and the New  video game system is currently being made. In the past, studios lived or died by the success of their most recent release. This constant feast or famine cycle created an unstable environment for the artists and engineers working on them. As titans fell to the slow loss of money over time, new ideas and management were needed to keep studios alive. Alternative forms of revenue like selling merchandise, Twitch streams, crowdsourcing, community management, and studio buyouts have changed the way studios run their businesses and release games. These new avenues for resources have cycled in new talent from outside sources giving birth to new opinions and perspectives. Similar to the <em>New Hollywood</em> system, I think the <em>New</em> video game system currently being formed will bring about new ideas that will ultimately make the video game industry better.</p>
<p>Then last, it seems like games today are becoming more Auteur and less franchise driven. Recently, there has been a trend where larger companies purchase smaller studios to improve their gaming portfolio. It looks like the parent companies purchase these smaller studios not because they need a factory for making the next installment in a franchise, but because the public enjoys the type of games these smaller studios are known for. It appears that these parent companies buy the studio with the intention of setting them free to make the games they desire with the financial backing they need. Similar to the <em>New</em> Hollywood system creating Auteur films in the 70s, it looks like the games industry is following a similar structure. More game studios are given the freedom to make the games they desire that reflect their own creative visions.</p>
<p>I am extremely excited for the future of the video game industry and the stories that will be told through this medium. Just like the 1970s film industry, I think the video game industry is about to enter a renaissance that will be talked about for decades to come.</p>
